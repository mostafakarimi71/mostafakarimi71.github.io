= About Me
I am currently a data and applied scientist in Microsoft. I interned in Ancestry and Anadarko Petroleum as a data scientist in summer of 2019 and 2018. I graduated with a Ph.D. degree at Texas A&M University (TAMU) in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of Professor [https://shen-lab.github.io/ Yang Shen] in 2020. 
I worked as a graduate research assistant affiliated with the [http://gsp.tamu.edu/ Genomic Signal Processing Laboratory] and the [http://cbgse.tamu.edu/ Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering]. My research lied at the intersection of Combinatorial Optimization and Machine Learning with applications in Molecular Biology and Genetics.
Before joining TAMU, I received a B.S. in [http://ee.sharif.ir/ Electrical Engineering] and a B.S. in [http://mathsci.sharif.ir/ Computer Science] from [http://www.sharif.ir/home Sharif University of Technology (SUT)] in 2015. 
At SUT, I was a member of [http://acri.sharif.ir/home Advanced Communications Research Institute] under the supervision of Professor [http://acri.sharif.ir/resume/marvasti Farokh Marvasti] for three years.
